# Introduction

The **arc-validate-package-registry (avpr)** repository contains:

- a staging area for authoring official validation packages intended for use with [`arc-validate`](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/arc-validate).
- a web API for serving validation packages. This API is consumed by `arc-validate` to install and sync validation packages.
- a website for browsing validation packages.
- some domain types and utilities relevant for consuming libraries in the [AVPRIndex library](./src/AVPRIndex/)
- a .NET client library for consuming the web API in the [AVPRClient library](./src/AVPRClient/)

# General

## CI/CD pipeline

This repo runs an [extensive CI/CD pipeline](.github/workflows/pipeline.yml) on every commit and PR on the `main` branch. The pipeline includes:

- tests and pre-publish checks for every package in the [staging area](#validation-package-staging-area).
- a release pipeline for validation packages:
  - publishing WIP packages to the `avpr-preview-index` on this repo's [preview-index](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/arc-validate-package-registry/releases/tag/preview-index) release
  - publishing stable packages to the production instance of the web API at [avpr.nfdi4plants.org](https://avpr.nfdi4plants.org)
- tests and release pipelines for the `AVPRIndex` and `AVPRClient` libraries, as well as a docker container for the `PackageRegistryService` web API.

# Validation package staging area

The [package staging area](./StagingArea) is intended for development and testing of validation packages.

Files in this folder must follow the naming convention `<package-name>@<major>.<minor>.<patch>.*` and contain a [yml frontmatter](#package-metadata) at the start of the file. These files must additionally be inside a subfolder exactly named as the package name. This leads to a folder structure like this:

```no-highlight
StagingArea
â”‚ 
â”œâ”€â”€ some-package
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ some-package@1.0.0.fsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ some-package@2.0.0.fsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ some-package@2.1.0.fsx
â”‚ 
â””â”€â”€ some-other-package
    â”œâ”€â”€ some-other-package@1.0.0.fsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ some-other-package@2.0.0.fsx
    â””â”€â”€ some-other-package@3.0.0.fsx
```

## Allowed validation package file formats

As all reference implementations are written in F#/.NET, the only currently allowed file format for validation packages is `.fsx` (F# script files). This can and will be expanded in the future.

## Automated package testing

Any change to a package in the staging area triggers the tests located at [/StagingAreaTests](./StagingAreaTests), which are run on every package. (see also [CI/CD pipeline](#cicd-pipeline)). publishing packages to the preview index or the production registry is only possible if all tests pass.

## Package publication workflow

In principle, packages can be published via 2 channels:

- **The preview index:**
  
  The pipeline includes a `Update preview index` CI step that extracts metadata from the [yml frontmatter](#package-metadata) of every `.fsx` file in the staging area and (if tests and sanity checks pass) adds it to the `avpr-preview-index.json` on this repo's [preview-index](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/arc-validate-package-registry/releases/tag/preview-index) release.

  This process is done automatically for ervery package mewrged into main, and needs no manual intervention.

- **The production registry:**

  Packages set to `publish: true` in their yml frontmatter will be published to the production registry database if they pass all tests and pre-publish checks. 

## Package publication tutorial

Publishing a package to the registry is a multi-step process:

Suppose you want to develop version 1.0.0 of a package called `my-package`.

1. fork this repo
2. Add a new blank `my-package@1.0.0.fsx` file to the [staging area](./StagingArea/) in the folder `my-package`.
3. Develop the package, using a work-in-process pull request to use this repository's CI to perform automated integrity tests on it. If you want to pre-release the package to the preview index, request a review for a merge into the `main` branch at any time.
4. Once the package is ready for production use, add `publish: true` to the [yml frontmatter](#package-metadata) of the package file. This will trigger the CI to build and push the package to the registry once the PR is reviewed and merged.
5. Once a package is published, it cannot be unpublished or changed. To update a package, create a new script with the same name and a higher version number.

| stage | availability | mutability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| staging: development in this repo | version of current HEAD commit in this repo via github API-based execution in `arc-validate` CLI | any changes are allowed |
| published: available in the registry | version of the published package via the registry API | no changes are allowed |

## Versioning packages

Packages SHOULD be versioned according to the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) standard. This means that the version number of a package should be incremented according to the following rules:

- **Major version**: incremented when you make changes incompatible with previous versions
- **Minor version**: incremented when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
- **Patch version**: incremented when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes

# Package metadata

## YAML frontmatter

Package metadata is extracted from **yml frontmatter** at the start of the `.fsx` file, indicated by a multiline comment (`(* ... *)`)containing the frontmatter fenced by `---` at its start and end:
  
```fsharp
(*
---
<yaml frontmatter here>
---
*)
```

## Frontmatter bindings

You can additionally bind YAML frontmatter as a string inside your package. **This is recommended** because you can now re-use the metadata in your package code.

This binding must be placed at the start of the file to the name `PACKAGE_METADATA` with a `[<Literal>]` attribute _exactly_ like this:

```fsharp
let [<Literal>] PACKAGE_METADATA = """(*
---
<yaml frontmatter here>
---
*)"""
```

further down in your package code, you can now extract and use this metadata. This for example prevents you from having to repeat the package name in your package code.

```fsharp
#r "nuget: ARCExpect"
#r "nuget: AVPRIndex"
let metadata = ValidationPackageMetadata.extractFromString PACKAGE_METADATA

let validationCases = ...

cases
|> Execute.ValidationPipeline(
    metadata = metadata // use metadata to determine output paths and names instead of doing it manually
)
```

# Development

Prerequisites:

- .NET 8 SDK
- Docker
- Docker Compose

Advanced local dev functionality has only been tested on Windows with Visual Studio. For that, install the ASP.NET core workload including container features, which will enable running the `Docker Compose` project in Debug mode.

## AVPRIndex and AVPRClient libraries

The `AVPRIndex` and `AVPRClient` libraries are located in `/src` and are intended for use in consuming applications.

To build them, just run `dotnet build` in the respective project folders or build the `arc-validate-package-registry` solution.

### Triggering a nuget release

- Bump the version in the respective `csproj` or `fsproj` file
- Update the respective RELEASE_NOTES.md file
- CI will automatically publish the package to the nuget feed

## Web API and website (PackageRegistryService)

The `PackageRegistryService` project located in `/src` is a simple ASP.NET Core (8) web API that serves validation packages and/or associated metadata via a few endpoints.

It is developed specifically for containerization and use in a docker environment.

To run the `PackageRegistryService` locally, ideally use VisualStudio and run the `Docker Compose` project in Debug mode. This will launch the stack defined at [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml), which includes:

- the containerized `PackageRegistryService` application
- a `postgres` database seeded with the [latest indexed packages](src/PackageRegistryService/Data/arc-validate-package-index.json)
- an `adminer` instance for database management (will maybe be replaced by pgAdmin in the future)

In other IDEs, you can run the `PackageRegistryService` project directly or adjust the stack, but you will need to either set up a local postgres database and configure the connection string in `appsettings.json` accordingly or fine-tune the existing docker-compose file..

### Triggering a image release

Currently, any change in `src/PackageRegistryService` will trigger a release to the production registry. This is done by the CI/CD pipeline, which builds and pushes a docker image to the registry on every relevant commit to the `main` branch.

This will move to a versioned release process in the future.

### OpenAPI endpoint documentation via Swagger UI

The `PackageRegistryService` has a built-in Swagger UI endpoint for API documentation. It is served at `/swagger/index.html`.

## Testing

There are 2 solutions that contain test projects:

- `arc-validate-package-registry.sln` contains the test projects for the `AVPRIndex` and `AVPRClient` libraries, as well as future API and integration tests located in `/tests`.
- `PackageStagingArea.sln` contains the tests and sanity checks for all packages in the staging area.

Run the tests with `dotnet test` in the respective test project folders or on the respective solution.

## Release packages to production

Automated package releases are currently only performed to the preview index.

If you are an authorized user with an API key, packages can be pushed to prod with the `AVPRCI` CLI tool in this repo:

in the repo root, run:

```shell
dotnet run --project .\src\AVPRCI\AVPRCI.fsproj -- publish --api-key yourKeyHere --dry-run
```

to see what would be published, and remove the `--dry-run` flag to actually publish the packages.
